    Hello, my name is Mohit Patel, and I have created this website to help me practise coding an actual website.
    I will try and implement more features as I continue to learn more things, but for now, this will just be an HTML blurb.
    To make you less dissapointed, I will leave you with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAEQvlaZgKY"> my favourite inspirational YouTube video. </a>
    I hope you all will have a great day!
